        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm pursuing a PhD at the University of Antwerp in the lab of Prof. Guillermo A. Pérez. My research focusses on applying techniques from formal methods to reinforcement learning. Aside from research I also teach four courses on compilers, software engineering, and computer architecture.</p>

    <h3>ESSLLI 2023 summer school</h3>
    August 2023<br>
    <p>
        This was a summer school on logic, language, and computation. I attended courses on linear arithmetic, formal language theory applied to RNNs, PAC learning of logical formulas, natural language parsing, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>MOVEP 2024 summer school</h3>
    May 2024<br>
    <p>
        There were courses on SMT-solving, model checking, and reinforcement learning. This was also a great opportunity to meet other people in the field of theoretical computer science.
    </p>

    <h3>BNAIC 2024 conference</h3>
    Nov 2024<br>
    <p>
        I attended talks on reinforcement learning and SAT-solving and had the opportunity to meet many interesting people doing research in AI.
    </p>

    <h3>Storm days 2025</h3>
    March - April 2025<br>
    <p>
        This event brought together researchers that make use of the Storm model checker. People presented their Storm-related research during various talks and we brainstormed (pun!) on how to further improve Storm.

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <h3>Teaching assistance</h3>
     <p>
        I oversee the lab sessions of multiple courses:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Computer systems and architecture:</b> a course where students build their own CPU in Logisim, a simulator for digital circuits.</li>
            <li><b>Project software engineering:</b> a project over the course of an entire semester where students have to put together a software system. In doing so, the students have to pay attention to project management, software testing, quality control, and object oriented programming principles.</li>
            <li><b>Compilers:</b> groups of students build a compiler that translates C code into LLVM IR, MIPS, and native binary code.</li>
            <li><b>Software engineering:</b> in this course we cover a different topic in each lab session. Topics include formal methods, software testing, software architecture, quality control, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Thesis supervision</h3>
    <p>
        I have supervised multiple thesis and research projects on topics that are related to my PhD, such as reinforcement learning and dynamical systems.
