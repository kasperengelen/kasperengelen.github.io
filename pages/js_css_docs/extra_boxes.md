The software powering this website provides tools to typeset TODOs, as well as notes and warnings. The TODO feature is useful when one wants to annotate a document that is still a work-in-progress. The warnings can be used to indicate that the reader needs to be careful, and the notes can inform the reader of things that are useful to keep in mind.
